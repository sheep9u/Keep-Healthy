# Energy

> Macronutrients in food, beverages and alcohol fuel metabolism, organ function and physical activity, resulting in consumption of oxygen and production of heat and carbon dioxide (CO2).

食物、饮料和酒精中的常量营养素促进新陈代谢、器官功能和身体活动，导致氧气消耗以及热量和二氧化碳 (CO2) 的产生。

> Our body uses energy to fuel cellular metabolism, especially the major organs like brain, heart, liver and gastrointestinal tract, and for physical activity. Carbohydrates and proteins each provide 17 kJ/g of metabolizable energy intake, with fats and alcohol providing 37 kJ/g and 29 kJ/g respectively. Our appetite mechanism usually allows us to match energy intake to energy expenditure so that we maintain a healthy body weight, but when we overeat, the excess energy intake is stored as fat. Overweight people should aim for an energy intake slightly less than their energy expenditure so that their energy deficit is met from their body fat, helping them to achieve a lower, healthy body weight. Our total energy expenditure (TEE) depends on the rate at which the body expends energy at rest (basal metabolic rate – BMR) and our physical activity level (PAL), and this is expressed by the relationship: TEE = PAL x BMR. BMR can be predicted from body weight, sex and age, and PAL varies with lifestyle from 1.35 in sedentary people to 2.5 for the very active. At an average PAL of 1.63, men and women of average height need 11 MJ and 9 MJ of food energy each day for a healthy body weight.

我们的身体使用能量来促进细胞新陈代谢，尤其是大脑、心脏、肝脏和胃肠道等主要器官，以及身体活动。碳水化合物和蛋白质各提供 17 kJ/g 的可代谢能量摄入，脂肪和酒精分别提供 37 kJ/g 和 29 kJ/g。 我们的食欲机制通常允许我们将能量摄入与能量消耗相匹配，从而保持健康的体重，但当我们吃得过饱时，多余的能量摄入就会以脂肪的形式储存起来。 超重者的目标应该是摄入的能量略低于消耗的能量，这样他们的能量不足就可以通过体内脂肪来弥补，从而帮助他们达到较低的健康体重。 我们的总能量消耗 (TEE) 取决于身体在休息时消耗能量的速率（基础代谢率 – BMR）和我们的体力活动水平 (PAL)，这由以下关系表示：TEE = PAL x BMR。 BMR 可以根据体重、性别和年龄来预测，PAL 会随着生活方式的不同而变化，从久坐的人的 1.35 到非常活跃的人的 2.5。 平均 PAL 为 1.63，平均身高的男性和女性每天需要 11 MJ 和 9 MJ 的食物能量才能保持健康的体重。

## Protein 蛋白质

## Carbohydrates 碳水化合物

> Carbohydrates are one of the three main components of the diet (the macronutrients) and provide the major substrate for energy metabolism within the brain, kidney medulla and red blood cells. Carbohydrates are also important for muscle function in highintensity exercise. Whilst dietary carbohydrates can range from molecules such as glucose and fructose (the simple sugars), through the disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, lactose) to the complex polymers of glucose found in starch, all dietary forms are digested within the intestine so that the simple sugars are the molecules that are absorbed into the body. Dietary recommendations for healthy people suggest carbohydrates should provide between 45 and 60% of dietary energy, depending on age, physical activity and body weight. High intakes of the simple sugars, sucrose or maltose, and even rapidly digested refined grains, are associated with risks to health, including tooth decay and unintentional overconsumption of energy (leading to weight gain). A healthy diet should have most carbohydrate in the complex form, particularly when contained in high-fibre wholegrain cereals and vegetables. The idea that carbohydrate is somehow toxic and that low-carbohydrate diets should be eaten by all is not backed up by research. 

碳水化合物是饮食的三个主要成分（常量营养素）之一，为大脑、肾髓质和红细胞内的能量代谢提供主要基质。 碳水化合物对于高强度运动中的肌肉功能也很重要。 虽然膳食碳水化合物的范围从葡萄糖和果糖（单糖）等分子，到双糖（蔗糖、麦芽糖、乳糖），再到淀粉中葡萄糖的复合聚合物，所有膳食形式都在肠道内消化，因此简单 糖是被人体吸收的分子。 针对健康人的饮食建议表明，碳水化合物应提供 45% 至 60% 的膳食能量，具体取决于年龄、身体活动和体重。 大量摄入单糖、蔗糖或麦芽糖，甚至是快速消化的精制谷物，都与健康风险有关，包括蛀牙和无意中过度消耗能量（导致体重增加）。 健康的饮食应该含有复合形式的大部分碳水化合物，尤其是当含有高纤维全麦谷物和蔬菜时。 碳水化合物在某种程度上是有毒的，所有人都应该吃低碳水化合物饮食的想法并没有得到研究的支持。

## Fibre 纤维

> Dietary fibre is the indigestible component of foods and drinks which has a bulking effect in the large intestine and provides a substrate for the colonic bacteria. Originally, ‘fibre’ was limited to non-starch polysaccharides (such as cellulose) plus lignin from plants. In recent years the definition of fibre has widened to include all food components that are not digested and absorbed in the small intestine, including the non-digestible oligosaccharides (which are between the simple sugars and the starch polymers) and resistant starch. There is also an increasing use of novel, synthetic fibres in processed foods and drinks. Recent research suggests that a high intake of dietary fibre, particularly cereal fibre and whole grains, is associated with a reduced risk of cardiometabolic disease and colorectal cancer. Higher intakes of some fibre components are also associated with reductions in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerols as well as blood pressure. As a result, in recent years many countries have raised the recommended intake of dietary fibre to 30 grams (1 oz) or more for adults – almost twice the average present intake. The novel fibres, such as polydextrose, are of potential benefit, but evidence is needed to show that they have beneficial effects in thepeople consuming them.

膳食纤维是食物和饮料中难以消化的成分，它在大肠中具有膨胀作用，并为结肠细菌提供基质。 最初，“纤维”仅限于非淀粉多糖（例如纤维素）加上植物中的木质素。 近年来，纤维的定义已经扩大到包括所有不被小肠消化和吸收的食物成分，包括不易消化的低聚糖（介于单糖和淀粉聚合物之间）和抗性淀粉。 在加工食品和饮料中也越来越多地使用新型合成纤维。 最近的研究表明，大量摄入膳食纤维，尤其是谷物纤维和全谷物，与降低患心脏代谢疾病和结直肠癌的风险有关。 某些纤维成分的摄入量增加也与血清胆固醇和三酰甘油以及血压的降低有关。 因此，近年来许多国家已将成人膳食纤维的推荐摄入量提高到 30 克（1 盎司）或更多——几乎是目前平均摄入量的两倍。 聚葡萄糖等新型纤维具有潜在益处，但需要证据证明它们对食用它们的人有益。

## Fats 脂肪

## Minerals 矿物质

> Minerals are inorganic substances that are not made by living things. Found in both soil and rocks, they are absorbed by plants that are then eaten. Minerals are largely classified as ‘major’ minerals or ‘trace’ minerals. Major minerals are those that the body requires in amounts of at least 100 mg per day, and include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, phosphorus and chloride. Trace minerals are needed in amounts of less than 100 mg per day, and some, such as iron, fluoride, zinc and manganese, have established recommended daily allowances (RDAs) or Adequate Intake (AI) limits to ensure adequacy. A third classification, known as ‘ultra-trace’ minerals, require less than 1 mg per day, and include chromium, copper, iodine, molybdenum and selenium. Minerals play a role in maintaining a healthy immune system, bone and teeth health, muscle contraction, fluid balance and overall growth. A healthy diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats is one way to ensure adequate intake of minerals; supplementation is another way. While deficiencies may present detrimental health conditions, it is important to be aware of intake amounts when supplementing, to avoid toxicity symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, which may occur with overconsumption. 

矿物质是不是由生物制造的无机物质。 它们存在于土壤和岩石中，被植物吸收，然后被食用。 矿物质主要分为“主要”矿物质或“微量”矿物质。 主要矿物质是人体每天至少需要 100 毫克的矿物质，包括钠、钾、钙、镁、硫、磷和氯化物。 每天需要的微量矿物质少于 100 毫克，铁、氟化物、锌和锰等一些矿物质已经制定了建议的每日摄入量 (RDA) 或充足摄入量 (AI) 限制以确保充足。 第三类被称为“超微量”矿物质，每天需要少于 1 毫克，包括铬、铜、碘、钼和硒。 矿物质在维持健康的免疫系统、骨骼和牙齿健康、肌肉收缩、体液平衡和整体生长方面发挥着重要作用。 水果、蔬菜、全谷类和瘦肉的健康饮食是确保摄入足够矿物质的一种方法； 补充是另一种方式。 虽然缺乏可能会带来有害的健康状况，但重要的是要注意补充时的摄入量，以避免过度摄入时可能出现的毒性症状，例如恶心和呕吐。

# Foods

## Fruit ＆ Vegetables

> A high intake of fruits and vegetables has been associated with reduced risk of a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease in particular. 

大量摄入水果和蔬菜与降低许多慢性病的风险有关，尤其是心血管疾病。

> Fruit and vegetables are a major food group and are important components of a healthy diet. Diets rich in fruit and vegetables have been linked to a reduced risk of chronic disease, whereas low fruit and vegetable consumption has been linked to poor health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that, in 2013, an estimated 5.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to lower than recommended fruit and vegetable consumption. The evidence is strong for cardiovascular disease, relatively consistent for specific cancer sites and is weaker for both diabetes and obesity. Fruit and vegetables are micronutrient- and fibre-rich, as well as containing a range of beneficial non-nutrient components, including plant sterols, flavonoids and other bioactives, which have a range of potential health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Consuming a variety of fruit and vegetables will help to ensure an adequate intake of many of these essential nutrients. Fruit and vegetables are, therefore, recommended across all dietary guidelines. WHO suggests consuming more than 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day to improve overall health and reduce the risk of certain non-communicable diseases.

水果和蔬菜是主要的食物类别，也是健康饮食的重要组成部分。 富含水果和蔬菜的饮食与降低慢性病风险有关，而水果和蔬菜摄入量低与健康状况不佳有关。 世界卫生组织 (WHO) 表示，2013 年，全球估计有 520 万人死于低于建议的水果和蔬菜消费量。 心血管疾病的证据很强，特定癌症部位的证据相对一致，糖尿病和肥胖症的证据较弱。 水果和蔬菜富含微量营养素和纤维，还含有一系列有益的非营养成分，包括植物甾醇、类黄酮和其他生物活性物质，它们具有一系列潜在的健康益处，包括抗氧化和抗炎特性。 食用各种水果和蔬菜将有助于确保充分摄入其中许多必需营养素。 因此，所有膳食指南都推荐水果和蔬菜。 世卫组织建议每天食用 400 克以上的水果和蔬菜，以改善整体健康状况并降低某些非传染性疾病的风险。

## Milk ＆ Dairy 奶制品

> Milk is a highly nutritious food, with high absorbable calcium for bone health, yet humans are the only animals to drink milk throughout life. 

牛奶是一种高营养食品，含有高吸收钙质，有助于骨骼健康，但人类是唯一终生饮用牛奶的动物。

> Dairy foods are not essential in our diet, but can contribute to over 40% of daily intake of calcium, iodine, phosphorus and some B-vitamins in Europe and the USA. Dairy also provides a higher quality of protein than meat. All dairy foods are made from milk that comes from ruminant animals such as cows, sheep, goats and water buffalo and have been consumed for over 7,500 years in some European populations. There is a misconception that milk is a high-fat food, yet whole milk contains only 3.6% fat, semi-skimmed 1.7% and skimmed 0%. Dairy foods are the main contributor to saturated fat intake in many countries, but a high intake of dairy (excluding butter and cream) is not generally associated with heart disease risk. On the contrary, proteins, calcium, magnesium and probiotic bacteria in dairy foods have been linked to some beneficial effects on heart health, including lowering blood pressure. While some individuals develop an allergy to milk protein, others have lactose intolerance and are unable to digest dairy sugar (lactose). Interestingly, adult lactose intolerance is a normal condition in mammals. However, most humans have a genetic mutation that enables them to consume dairy products in adulthood, due to the persistence of lactase, required for lactose digestion. 

乳制品在我们的饮食中不是必不可少的，但在欧洲和美国可以贡献超过 40% 的钙、碘、磷和一些 B 族维生素的每日摄入量。 乳制品还提供比肉类更高质量的蛋白质。 所有乳制品均由反刍动物（如牛、绵羊、山羊和水牛）的奶制成，在一些欧洲人群中已有 7,500 多年的食用历史。 有一种误解认为牛奶是高脂肪食物，但全脂牛奶仅含 3.6% 的脂肪，半脱脂的 1.7% 和脱脂的 0%。 在许多国家，乳制品是饱和脂肪摄入的主要来源，但大量摄入乳制品（不包括黄油和奶油）通常与心脏病风险无关。 相反，乳制品中的蛋白质、钙、镁和益生菌与一些对心脏健康有益的作用有关，包括降低血压。 虽然有些人对牛奶蛋白过敏，但其他人则有乳糖不耐症，无法消化乳糖（乳糖）。 有趣的是，成人乳糖不耐症是哺乳动物的一种正常情况。 然而，由于消化乳糖所需的乳糖酶的持续存在，大多数人都有一种基因突变，使他们能够在成年后食用乳制品。

## Grains ＆ Gluten 谷物和麸质/面筋

> Gluten refers to proteins found in wheat, barley, rye and triticale, providing baked products with texture, moisture and flavour; however, it can cause an immunemediated reaction in the small intestine.

麸质是指存在于小麦、大麦、黑麦和小黑麦中的蛋白质，可为烘焙产品提供质地、水分和风味； 但是，它会在小肠中引起免疫介导的反应。

> The edible seeds from plants of the grass family are called ‘cereal grains’, or ‘cereals’. The general term for both the fruit (the seed or kernel) and the plant is ‘grain’. Major grain types worldwide are wheat, rice, corn (maize), barley, sorghum, oats, rye and millet. Other important plants that are used as grains but are not technically grains include wild rice, buckwheat, amaranth and quinoa. Wheat flour is the preferred flour for baking due to the formation of gluten when the flour is mixed with water and stirred or beaten, such as when making a batter or kneading a dough. Gluten, a mixture of two proteins, gliadin and glutenin, is responsible for the elastic texture of dough. Besides wheat, gluten can also be found in barley, rye and triticale. It gives baked goods soft, fluffy and moist qualities. Without it, bread would lose its shape, dry out and quickly become stale. However, individuals with coeliac disease (an autoimmune disorder that damages the small intestine), wheat allergy (allergic reactions caused by gluten or other wheat protein) or non-coeliac gluten sensitivity eat naturally gluten-free diets or products made with gluten-free flours, such as those from corn, rice, potato and soy, amongst others. 

草科植物的可食用种子被称为“谷物”或“谷类”。 果实（种子或果仁）和植物的总称是“谷物”。 世界范围内的主要谷物类型是小麦、水稻、玉米（玉蜀黍）、大麦、高粱、燕麦、黑麦和小米。 其他用作谷物但严格来说不是谷物的重要植物包括菰米、荞麦、苋菜和藜麦。 小麦粉是烘焙的首选面粉，因为当面粉与水混合并搅拌或敲打时会形成面筋，例如制作面糊或揉面团时。 面筋是两种蛋白质（麦醇溶蛋白和麦谷蛋白）的混合物，是面团弹性质地的原因。 除了小麦，大麦、黑麦和黑小麦中也含有麸质。 它赋予烘焙食品柔软、蓬松和湿润的品质。 没有它，面包会变形、变干并很快变质。 然而，患有乳糜泻（一种损害小肠的自身免疫性疾病）、小麦过敏（由麸质或其他小麦蛋白引起的过敏反应）或非腹腔麸质敏感性的人吃天然无麸质饮食或用无麸质面粉制成的产品 ，例如玉米、大米、马铃薯和大豆等。
